## Workflow Routing

### Automatic Routing

Items are automatically routed based on:

| Criteria | Routes To |
|----------|-----------|
| Policy changes | SGCC |
| Document approvals | SGCC |
| Individual exceptions | CRB |
| Windfall deals | CRB |
| Plan modifications | SGCC → CRB |

### Routing Rules

Configure routing rules at Settings → Workflows → Routing:

```yaml
rules:
  - name: "Policy Approval"
    trigger:
      type: "policy"
      status: "pending_approval"
    route_to: "sgcc"

  - name: "Exception Request"
    trigger:
      type: "case"
      case_type: "exception"
    route_to: "crb"

  - name: "High Value Deal"
    trigger:
      type: "case"
      financial_impact: "> 100000"
    route_to: "crb"
    escalate_to: "sgcc"
```

## SLA Configuration

### Default SLAs

| Committee | Priority | Target SLA |
|-----------|----------|------------|
| SGCC | Urgent | 1 day |
| SGCC | High | 3 days |
| SGCC | Medium | 5 days |
| SGCC | Low | 10 days |
| CRB | Urgent | Same day |
| CRB | High | 2 days |
| CRB | Medium | 3 days |
| CRB | Low | 5 days |

### Modifying SLAs

Configure at Settings → Workflows → SLAs:

```yaml
slas:
  sgcc:
    urgent: 1
    high: 3
    medium: 5
    low: 10
  crb:
    urgent: 0  # Same day
    high: 2
    medium: 3
    low: 5
```

### SLA Warnings

Configure warning thresholds:

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| **Warning threshold** | 50% | Show warning at this % of SLA |
| **Escalation threshold** | 80% | Auto-escalate at this % |
| **Overdue notification** | 100% | Notify at SLA breach |

## Escalation Rules

### Automatic Escalation

Configure auto-escalation at Settings → Workflows → Escalation:

```yaml
escalation:
  - name: "SLA Warning"
    trigger: "sla_percent >= 80"
    action: "notify_manager"

  - name: "SLA Breach"
    trigger: "sla_percent >= 100"
    action: "escalate_to_chair"

  - name: "High Value Automatic"
    trigger: "financial_impact >= 250000"
    action: "add_finance_review"
```

### Manual Escalation

Users can manually escalate items when:
- Case requires committee input
- Decision exceeds their authority
- Complex situation needs broader review

        condition: "document_type == 'policy'"

    - name: "Committee Approval"
      committee: "sgcc"
      required: true
```

### Conditional Steps

Add steps based on conditions:

| Condition | Example |
