# Governance Framework Reference

SGM uses a structured governance framework to organize policies, controls, and oversight mechanisms. This reference documents the framework structure.

## Framework Overview

The governance framework consists of:

- **6 Governance Pillars**: High-level governance categories
- **17 SCP Policies**: Detailed policy documents
- **2 Committees**: SGCC and CRB for governance decisions
- **55+ Requirements**: Specific compliance checkpoints

## Compliance Scoring

### Coverage Score Calculation

```
Coverage Score = (Covered Requirements / Total Requirements) × 100
```

### Risk Weighting

| Severity | Weight |
|----------|--------|
| Critical | 3.0 |
| High | 2.0 |
| Medium | 1.0 |
| Low | 0.5 |

### Compliance Score

```
Compliance Score = Σ(Covered × Weight) / Σ(Total × Weight) × 100
```

## Framework Integration

### With Gap Analysis

Gap analysis checks documents against framework requirements:
- Each requirement has a detection pattern
- Gaps are categorized by pillar and severity
- Remediation recommendations include policy references

### With Plans

Plan templates incorporate framework requirements:
- Sections mapped to policies
- Compliance validation before approval
- Version control with policy references

### With Audit

Audit trail tracks framework compliance:
- Policy decisions logged
- Committee approvals recorded
- Exception history maintained

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Annual review cycle">
    Review all policies annually. Update for regulatory changes, organizational changes, and lessons learned from exceptions and disputes.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Committee documentation">
    Document all committee decisions with rationale. Maintain meeting minutes and voting records for audit purposes.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Exception tracking">
    Track exception patterns to identify policy gaps or unclear language. Use exception data to inform policy updates.
  </Accordion>
