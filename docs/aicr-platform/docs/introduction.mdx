## What is AICR Platform?

AICR (AICodeRally Platform) is a **self-aware, AI-native platform** that orchestrates the creation, operation, and commercialization of software products through a sophisticated three-layer architecture.

### Core Innovation

AICR is **self-documenting and self-aware** - it understands its own architecture through indexed canonical documentation that agents can query in real-time. This enables AI agents to work autonomously while maintaining architectural consistency.

## Key Features

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="brain" title="Self-Aware Architecture">
    AICR understands its own architecture through indexed canonical documentation. AI agents can query the platform's structure, contracts, and patterns in real-time to make informed decisions.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="robot" title="14 Specialized AI Agents">
    Collaborative AI agent system with clear role separation including Builder, Designer, OpsChief, QA, and more. Each agent has persistent memory and understands the platform architecture.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="database" title="240-Table Database Architecture">
    Enterprise-grade database with 48 tenant-scoped models, 41 enums, and comprehensive audit trails. All access through Prisma ORM with contract enforcement.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="shield-check" title="Enforced Governance">
    Contracts validated at runtime through guard.ts. Three laws locked (Neon Everywhere, Neon Branches, Prisma Only) with zero exceptions.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="cube" title="Deterministic Pack System">
    Versioned capability bundles with manifest validation, promotion workflows, and audit trails. Same inputs → same outputs guaranteed.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="users" title="Multi-Tenant by Design">
    48 tenant-scoped models with automatic isolation. Every tenant operation includes tenantId validation and authorization checks.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Three-Layer Architecture

    A[Summit Layer] --> B[Edge Layer]
    B --> C[Studio Layer]

    A --> D[Pack Marketplace]
    A --> E[Promotion Workflows]
    A --> F[Partner Onboarding]

    B --> G[Tenant Runtime]
    B --> H[Feature Flags]
    B --> I[Pack Resolver]

    C --> J[Pack Authoring]
    C --> K[Manifest Validation]
    C --> L[Surface Testing]
```

### Studio → Edge → Summit

1. **Studio**: Build packs, validate manifests, test surfaces
2. **Edge**: Deploy to tenants, activate features, monitor operations
3. **Summit**: Manage marketplace, promote packs, oversee partners

## Strategic Differentiators

<Check>**Self-awareness** - No other platform queries its own architecture in real-time</Check>
<Check>**Enforced governance** - Contracts validated at runtime, not just documented</Check>
<Check>**Multi-tenant by design** - 48 tenant-scoped models with automatic isolation</Check>
<Check>**Deterministic resolution** - Pack system guarantees same inputs → same outputs</Check>
<Check>**AI-native design** - 14 specialized agents with persistent memory</Check>
